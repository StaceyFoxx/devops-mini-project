# 📘 README: How to Improve at Solving Coding Challenges

Solving coding challenges is a skill you develop through structure and repetition.  
This guide gives you a simple, reliable process for approaching any problem without feeling overwhelmed.

# 🔁 The Coding Challenge Process (Step-by-Step)

## 1. Read the problem slowly (don’t start coding yet)

Before typing anything:

- Understand the inputs  
- Understand the expected output  
- Identify constraints (size limits, performance needs, special rules)  
- Ask yourself: **“What is the problem really asking me to find?”**

> 💡 *Rewrite the problem in your own words to confirm your understanding.*

---

## 2. Walk through a simple example manually

Pick a small input and solve it like a human.

> **Example**  
> Input: [5, 1, 9, 3]  
> Output: [3, 5, 9]

This builds intuition and helps you see the steps clearly.

> 💡 *If you can solve a tiny example by hand, you can code it.*

## 3. Identify the core idea (the strategy)

Before writing any code, decide on an approach:

- Can you sort?  
- Do you track values manually?  
- Do you need a specific data structure (list, set, dict, heap)?  
- Do you loop once or multiple times?

You're choosing the **general plan** before you write actual code.

---

## 4. Write pseudocode first

Pseudocode keeps you focused on the logic instead of syntax.

> **Example pseudocode:**  
> - Create a structure to store the top 3 values  
> - Loop through each number  
> - Compare the number to the stored values  
> - Shift values down if needed  
> - Return the final three values  

This step removes the majority of the overwhelm.

## 5. Translate your pseudocode into Python

Now turn each pseudocode step into real code.  
Keep it simple. Don’t optimise prematurely.  
Build in small pieces and test as you go.

---

## 6. Test your solution

Use:

- A normal example  
- Edge cases  
- Cases with duplicates  
- Negative numbers  
- Large inputs (if relevant)

This verifies correctness and robustness.

---

## 7. Reflect and improve

Ask yourself:

- What confused me?  
- What pattern did I learn?  
- Could my solution be simpler or faster?  
- What will I remember for next time?

Reflection accelerates your skill.

# 🧠 How to Get Better Over Time

## A. Practice breaking problems into small steps  
Big problems feel overwhelming when tackled as one piece.  
Solve *one tiny part* at a time.

## B. Learn to recognise common patterns  
Many challenges follow repeated patterns:

- Sliding window  
- Two pointers  
- Hashmaps  
- Sorting + scanning  
- Tracking max/min  
- Dynamic programming  

The more you practise, the more these patterns become automatic.

## C. Don’t fear being “wrong”  
Your first attempt is not meant to be perfect.  
Iteration is normal for developers.

## D. Use diagrams and examples  
Walk through logic with real numbers.  
If the example works, coding becomes easier.

## E. Review after solving  
A 1-minute reflection dramatically improves long-term skill.

# 🧩 A Simple Template to Use Every Time

1. Rewrite the problem in your own words  
2. Solve one tiny example manually  
3. Identify the core idea / pattern  
4. Write pseudocode  
5. Convert pseudocode into Python  
6. Test with multiple cases  
7. Reflect and refine

# ⭐ Final Thoughts

Coding challenges are not about natural talent — they are about **method**.  
By following this structured process, you will become more confident, faster, and far less overwhelmed when faced with new problems.
