INPUTS


competitions
-  list of lists, each inner list represents a game
        - each game contains a [HOME team, AWAY team]

# competitions = [
#     ['Panthers', 'Lionesses'],
#     ['Lionesses', 'Dolphins'],
#     ['Dolphins', 'Panthers'],
# ]

results
- a list of numbers 0 or 1 representing which team won.
    - 1 means the HOME team won
    - 0 means the AWAY team won

# results = [0, 0, 1]

OUTPUT
 - Dolphins

NOTE
- a team will ALWAYS win within each game pair
- if a team WINS, they get 3 points, if they lose they get 0 points
- the team with the most gained points at the end of the competition wins
- the list of games (in the competitions) ALWAYS matches the list of results,
    same length of lists!!

By hand I would:
- match the result of each game against the result list to see which team was the winner and which was the loser
    - keeping in mind the home team is first in each pair and away team is lost in each pair
- assign in tracker the team and give them 3 points
- sum up the pionts from my winning tracker, then take the team with highest score
