🧃 Challenge 1: Juice Bar Orders
🍊 Concept

You run a juice bar and keep track of which juice sells the most during the day.
You’ll be given a list of juice orders (e.g., "Mango", "Apple", etc.).
Each order adds 1 sale to that juice’s count.

Your job is to determine:
    Which juice was sold the most
    How many cups of it were sold

🧩 Example Input
orders = [
    "Mango", "Apple", "Mango", "Berry", "Apple", "Apple",
    "Berry", "Mango", "Mango", "Berry"
]

🧮 Expected Output
🥤 The most popular juice is Mango with 4 orders!
