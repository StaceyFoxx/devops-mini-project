EXAMPLE 2

(!!! use file: 5.3_example_two.txt, save this file in the same folder as your Python program! )

We need to demonstrate that our first solution would not work with a file that has any punctuation.
So try running file No 2 with our code to demonstrate that the result is wrong.

Now we need to modify our solution to make it compatible with ANY file with or without punctuation.

NB: there are two examples on how to solve EXAMPLE 2. Let's work with both of them.

Create a program that meets the requirements above - think creatively!

OPTIONAL - Extra credit: refine your solution above by using a translator instead:
e.g. line = line.translate(line.maketrans("", "", string.punctuation))
we will review this solution example in the drop in session on Thrusday
