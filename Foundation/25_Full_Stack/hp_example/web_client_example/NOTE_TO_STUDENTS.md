# Note to Students

The "index.html" file in this folder is only meant as a class demo (see session recording).
HTML, Javascript, CSS are completely outside the scope of this course.
So do not stress about anything relating to them.

If you are interested do DM me on slack and I'll point you to relevant resources.
