## 🏢 For Students Entering into a Job Role
 
Here’s how to make the most of your onboarding and stand out early.

### 🧭 Before You Start
- Research your team’s tech stack (ask for documentation or shadowing opportunities)
- Review company culture, values, and tech blogs
- Brush up on key concepts related to your assigned area (e.g. Python scripts, SQL pipelines, front-end frameworks)

### ⚙️ Skills to Sharpen
- **Version Control:** Using Git in collaborative projects (branch naming, PR etiquette)
- **Agile & Scrum:** Understanding sprints, stand-ups, and retrospectives
- **Documentation:** Writing clear Confluence or Markdown documentation
- **Data Literacy:** Understanding how your work fits into the company’s data flow

### 💬 Professional Habits
- **Ask early, not late:** It’s better to ask questions than to guess and delay work.  
- **Keep a learning log:** Track what you learn each week — this helps during reviews.
- **Shadow colleagues:** Observe how others structure code, write emails, or present findings.
- **Find a mentor:** If your company offers one, use that time to ask career & skill growth questions.

### 🧠 Recommended Tools for a Smooth Start
| Category | Tool / Platform | Why It Helps |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Task Tracking | Jira / Trello / Notion | Stay organized and track deliverables |
| Notes | Notion / Obsidian / OneNote | Keep a “learning brain dump” |
| Version Control | Git + GitHub / GitLab | Collaborate effectively |
| Debugging | VS Code Debugger / Postman | Practice diagnosing problems |
| Communication | Slack / Teams | Learn team communication etiquette |

💡 *Pro Tip:*  
At the end of each week, write down:
- 1 new technical concept you learned  
- 1 challenge you overcame  
- 1 question for next week  

This creates natural growth momentum.

Record your achievements to look back on in future! Also to use for feedback reviews.
